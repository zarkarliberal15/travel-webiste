  <h4 class="text-center">Tanah Lot</h4>
  <p>Located on a beautiful offshore rock in Tabanan regency, Bali, Tanah Lot or 'Land on the Sea' is a Hindu shrine believed to be about 500 years old. An amalgamation of Balinese and Hindu mythology, the base of the temple is carved with sea snakes and offers a natural source of holy water, providing visitors with an aesthetic and spiritual experience unlike any other.

    The Tanah Lot temple can be found some 300 metres (over 980 feet) off the island shore. It is one of seven temples along the Bali coast. In fact, from this beautiful rock temple, you can see the Pura Ulu Watu temple site on the cliffs to the south, and a long sweep of azure waters to the west, near Negara.
    
    Visiting the top of Tanah Lot is reserved for priests and Bali locals, but tourists are allowed to wander the base of the temple and receive blessings from the small shrine there. Because of its astounding architecture and intricate rock faces, set against the breath-taking Indonesian waters with a clear sight of the sun as it sets, Tanah Lot is considered a photographer's paradise.</p>

  <h4 class="text-center">Mount Batur</h4>
 <p>Called "Gunung Batur" in the local language, Mount Batur is an active volcano in Indonesia. At 1717 metres (around 5,600 feet) above sea level, it offers a spectacular view of its surroundings - the majestic Lake Batur, nestled amongst black lava from the last explosion in 2000, and adjacent to this all, beautiful mountains.

  In 2012, UNESCO announced Mount Batur Caldera, the collapsed top at the top, as a part of the Global Geoparks Network, an effort to preserve the planet's geological heritage. The volcano is a popular trekking destination amongst tourists and locals alike. Because of its beautiful views and relative ease to climb, Mount Batur is considered a must-visit in Bali.</p>

  <h4 class="text-center">Ulu Watu</h4>
  <p>Situated at the south-western tip of Bukit in Bali, Uluwatu attracts surfers of all levels from around the world to its exciting shoreline. The waves are composed of five world-class surf breaks, and the hotels and restaurants overlooking the Indian ocean provide a magnificent view. The Pura Luru Uluwatu temple is another important attraction in this area.

    Situated at the south-western tip of Bukit in Bali, the short strip of beach called Uluwatu attracts surfers of all levels from around the world to its exciting shoreline. Uluwatu comes from the words "ulu" meaning 'land's end' and "watu" meaning rock. The waves here are composed of five world-class surf breaks, and the hotels and restaurants overlooking the Indian Ocean provide a magnificent view.
    Uluwatu's beaches are incredibly beautiful, but it is ultimately a surfing destination because of its tricky waves. These are not suitable for swimming. So if you aren’t inclined to go surfing in Uluwatu, keep in mind that it’s mostly a destination to relax and there isn’t much to do around here.</p>
